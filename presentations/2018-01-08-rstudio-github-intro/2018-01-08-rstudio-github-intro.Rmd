Github is an online framework for version-controlled file sharing that is mostly used for code-related projects. A major advantage of version-controlled file sharing is that multiple people can work on the same project without worrying about version conflicts. However, even for single-person projects, version-controlled file sharing can be very useful, because it enables easy code backups and promotes organization. 

One of the many advantages of working with RStudio is that it has integrated support for Github. This means that with a few button clicks you can pull new changes to a repository, add new files or changes old ones, and push (i.e. upload) your changes. 

As an introduction to working with Github via RStudio, this post will walk through the steps necessary for accessing the RDojo Github repository.
