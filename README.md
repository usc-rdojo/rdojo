# RDojo

This is the repository for the USC R club, RDojo. RDojo meets bi-weekly to discuss and present on using RStudio for statistical computing. Each RDojo presentation is written as an R Notebook and published as a blog post on our website [https://usc-rdojo.github.io/](https://usc-rdojo.github.io/) as well as stored in this repository in the 'presentations' directory.
